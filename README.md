# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms With C++
Welcome to the Data Structures Problems repository! This repository is a collection of various data structures problems, solutions, and explanations, designed to help others learn and practice common and advanced data structures in C++.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of problems for anyone looking to enhance their understanding of data structures. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, learning DSA for the first time, or just looking to brush up on your knowledge, you'll find a wide variety of problems covering all major data structures.

## What's Inside?
Here’s a breakdown of the key areas you'll find in this repository:

* **Arrays**: Solutions to basic and advanced array problems.
* **Linked Lists**: Problems involving singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
* **Stacks and Queues**: Classic problems involving these fundamental data structures.
Trees and Graphs: Binary trees, AVL trees, and graph-based problems.
* **Heaps**: Problems focused on heap implementation and usage.
* **Hashing**: Examples and problems involving hash tables and sets.
* **Advanced Topics**: Problems involving tries, segment trees, and more.

  Each section will contain:

  * Problem Statement
  * Explanation of Approach
  * C++ Code Implementation
  * Time and Space Complexity Analysis
